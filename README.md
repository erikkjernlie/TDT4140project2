# TDT4140project2

UNIBOT
Our project consist of developing a native application for the Android Platform
The app will assist potentional applicants for civ.ing-studies at NTNU Gløshaugen
with finding relevant information and recommendations based on the user's interests,
using an AI-chatbot api

In order to run the program on a computer during the development phase, one would need
to install a program called Android Studio and open the project from there.

The native app for Android with its functions are made using
- Java for programming
- XML for sharing
- Firebase for database storage
- API.AI with google voice api for AI-behaviour

The app is made by
- Herman Wika Horn
- Jonas Sagild
- Erik Kjernlie
- Jørgen Mortensen
from the Engineering and ICT study at NTNU

with contributions from
- Pekka Abrahamsson, lecturer for the TDT4140 course
- Kari Eline Strandjord, student assistant for our group
